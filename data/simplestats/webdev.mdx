# Tutorials

I will go over most of the files in my website. 

If you want a more in-depth explanation on how to create a website and host it, look at these YouTube videos.

I learned a lot about the structure of React and Next.js from this youtuber Benjamin Carlson, and I think this is a great resource for anyone who wants to get started in web development but doesn’t want to start learning from the ground up. 

If you want to start learning from the ground up, I suggest getting the fundamentals of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML down. These are programming languages that allow you to build a web application, but tools like React allow you to create websites with a lot more functionality much faster.

2. [CSS Tutorial](https://youtu.be/I9XRrlOOazo)
3. [JavaScript Tutorial](https://youtu.be/qoSksQ4s_hg) 
4. [React Tutorial](https://youtu.be/yZ0f1Apb5CU)
5. [Next.js Tutorial](https://youtu.be/A63UxsQsEbU) 

Before you begin with React, I would suggest learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re impatient like me and you immediately want to get to the fun stuff, there may be gaps in your understanding, but it’ll probably feel more exciting. 

I’ll try to explain how you can set up a quick page using this awesome Next.js setup.

Start by downloading VS Code, as this is the IDE I use for web development.
Download VS Code using this video: [Download VS Code](https://youtu.be/JGsyJI8XG0Y)

Then, you will need to download Node.js and set up your environment.
This video can take you through setting up Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://youtu.be/__7eOCxJyow)

Now we can create our first webpage!
Open VS Code and your terminal.

Now enter this into your terminal in VS Code: yarn create next-app

You now have your project, pretty easy right? 

### My Website

Let’s go over what a bunch of the files mean. These are the short notes I recorded when I tried to learn more about web development. They are not supposed to give you the full picture, but give you more support when you try to create your own project.

**Package.json**: lives in root directory of project; needs name, version, scripts, dependencies; package version number, human readable, dependencies needed by project, enables npm (uses javascript and command line to run programs) or yarn to start project<br />

**Yarn.lock**: locks down dependencies in package.json file, so, if dependency changed by creator, you don’t get different dependencies, what you imported will be in this file<br />

**.gitignore**: git tracks changes in files, gitignore just lists files you want left alone be git I think?<br />

**Theme.js**: how you want your fonts, etc to look like, imported from chakra ui, const overrides means all our fonts will be the same, we change from default node.js fonts<br />

**Prism.js**: styling for website, makes the code on your website look nice<br />

**Public**: where I keep images<br />

**Lib/mdx.js**: connect mdx files using slug to blog, show word count and reading time, get mdx components, I think grey matter organizes title, process.cwd() get working directory of node.js file, export async has something to do with scheduling code to be run later, I think rendertostring has something to do with measuring time of accessing mdx files, rehype and remark take care of headings, code titles? .reduce executes reducer function, I think its adding the mdx files to the blog, basically get url of all mdx files, get static props gets each blog post<br />

**Layouts/blog.js**: use react, add date, use container from components for style, get slug and connect it to mdx files from data folder, deals with getting path of file, add picture to blog posts

**Layout/simplestats.js**: same thing basically as layout/blog.js, just replaced blog route with simplestats <br />

**/data**: contains markdown files for simplestats and blog page, this is where the blog posts are <br />

**Components/BlogPost.js & Components/SimpleStatsPost.js**:  use colormode to set text color in light and dark mode, add information from post and pass it to blog layout, link blog layout to slug (URL) <br />

**Components/Footer.js**: use footer layout, connect to index, add links <br />

**Components/DarkModeSwitch**: use chakra dark mode icon <br />

**Components/Container**: contains default page layout, children is content of page <br />

**Components/MDXComponents**: map the markdown element to html, add styles to html, pass props to p tag, can edit style of blog pages here <br />

**Pages/api/hello.js**: simple api router using json <br />

**Pages/blog/[slug].js**: create url for markdown files, so I can create as many markdown files as I want and they are connected to blog page, dynamic route, next/router shows dynamic route to user, grab dynamic rout using router.query, paths mapped to getStaticpaths, working with 1 requested blog post, plugins for page styling <br />

**Pages/simplestats/[slug].js**: same as Pages/blog/[slug].js but links to simplestats <br />

**Pages/_app.js**: import mdxcomponents, wrap it in components; entry point to app, wrap app in chakra ui <br />

**Pages/_document.js**: add to html and body tags, override default nextjs document file <br />

**Pages/blog.js**: return how blog page looks like, number of posts with .length, search icon, get posts from blog, sort by date published, tools from chakra ui <br />

**Pages/contactme.js**: simple contact me js file with form to get users to subscribe <br />

**Pages/index.js**: root of website, first page user sees when they select url <br />

**Pages/simplestats.js**: similar to Pages/blog.js <br />

Some important information:
    * Use export default function with arrow notation to define your functions in your pages, then import with {} notation
    * In BlogPost.js, you pass you posts into the variable props, and then you format with chakra ui and format it in a way that lets you use links to specific individual blog posts
    * Use mailchimp api to connect subscribers to your mail list
    * .env.local is where you say what kind of environment variables you use, store environment variables on vercel so they can’t be taken from your github repository
    * Asynchronous functions load before they fully run, so they are valuable when you want to gather data from files before using that data
    * _App.js and document.js allow you to override default nextjs template and format your files the way you want to
    * getStaticProps will fetch your blog posts
    * you sort the blog posts by the date they were published
    * getAllFilesFromFrontMatter allows you to get all of your mdx files, mdx is same as md but it lets you use react components
    * use fs in getAllFilesFromFrontMatter to read your directory blog in folder data, then you read the specific mdx file using grey matter, return mdx data and URL
    * to get a specific blog post, we use our dynamic [slug].js, you read values/files in function using getStaticProps, then use GetFileBySlug from mdx.js to fetch mdx file
    * use await renderToString to get content from file, then you forward that to MDXComponents so it can be rendered to HTML
    * Return reading time, etc to make page look good
    * getStaticPaths: tells application about different URLS in website, fallback false so that if URL doesn’t exist, bring out 404 page
    * const content = hydrate 
        * hydrate makes components/content interactable with mdx
    *container.js, remember to add meta tags for seo
    *for viewcounter, use viewcount api and swr(remote data fetching), maybe need firebase database
    *useColorMode interacts with darkmode and sets color of page
    * children passed in container after formatting done
    * if you use const function, make sure you use export default
    * async callback executes when file loading has completed, requires callback function for that reason
    * fs.readdirSync
        * returns the file name array with data of your file, but it will stop any further execution of your code until the read process ends., synchronous
    * files.reduce
        * performs a function on all elements in array
    * path.join
        * var path = require('path');
        * var x = path.join('Users', 'Refsnes', 'demo_path.js');
        * you end up getting: Users\Refsnes\demo_path.js
    * … turns array into individual elements, makes it easier to edit or read what is in array
