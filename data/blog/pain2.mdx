Welcome to another blog post!

Before I start this blog post, it’s time to get to the elephant in the room. How do you study pain in lab animals? Doesn’t it seem kind of messed up? Just my two cents, but we’re still going to try to analyze the findings. The title of this section doesn’t make sense to me, what is rodent based interrogation? 
Anyways, the reviewers state that changes in gamma waves are constantly seen when studying pain in humans and animals. Pain causes gamma waves to have a bigger amplitude (amplitude is like the height of an ocean wave, frequency is like the speed of a wave). So, maybe there are more neurotransmitters released due to the pain stimulus?
The parts of the brain that have these increased gamma oscillations in rodent models have been the somatosensory cortex and the cingulate cortex. Here are some pictures.
