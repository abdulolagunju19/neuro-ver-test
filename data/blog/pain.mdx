Welcome to another blog post! This post will be an informal stream of my thoughts as I read a research article.

## Quote of the Post
> Our normal expectations about reality are created by a social consensus. We are taught how to see and understand the world. the trick of socialization is to convince us that the descriptions we agree upon define the limits of the real world. What we call reality is only one way of seeing the world, a way that is supported by social consensus. - Carlos Castanedas

Let’s say no thank you to the abstract. That ruins all of the fun, right?

We all know pain a little too well. I still remember scraping my knee running after a soccer ball in the fourth grade—still have the scars too. But I’m not here today to talk about whether or not I’ve suffered through more in this life than you, I’m here to walk you through some science in the mind of a second-year neuroscience student. Today, we read through a review article outlining what brain oscillations can tell us about pain. Although, I don’t think any of you will quite understand the pain of watching your favourite team choke on live television (I’ll never forget that shot by Dame ☹).

There is a temporal lobe of the brain, responsible mainly some aspects of memory and hearing. There is an occipital lobe, responsible for sight. However, there is no region of the brain that is mainly responsible for dealing with pain perception. This makes it quite difficult to study. It seems like a myriad of brain regions deal with pain. 

This makes sense because you wouldn't want 1 brain region responsible for determining if a bear was chomping down on your foot, or if you had left your hand on the stove too long. You don’t want a malfunction in one of your lobes taking away the most important warning system in your body. 

The sensing of pain is such an important mechanism in the human body.

The reviewers state that research is pointing to certain brain waves indicating pain perception. Brain waves are just electrical signals we measure from the brain. This happens because inside the brain as ions (positive and negative particles) move around, allowing you to make your coffee in the morning. Why the oscillations happen, scientists still don’t know. So, let’s dive in and see if it makes sense.

Scientists more or less believe that action potentials (electrical signals moved across neurons via ions) are what get information from your muscles to your brain, and back down to your muscles so you can perform some behaviour. The oscillations range from intraslow to ultrafast.

Pain research has associated the feeling of pain with gamma and other high frequency bands, and less low frequency bands. These oscillatory rhythms are found in the somatosensory, insula, and prefrontal cortex. Pain may synchronized pain signaling in the brain, which results in a positive feedback mechanism in which. Pain may also cause amplitudes of low frequency oscillations to change, leading to the brain processing this as some sort of pain stimulus and responding to it.

There have been some results found for people with chronic pain, but I feel like they aren’t revealing any pattern that make sense to me. Some brain regions show different brain waves when compared to healthy patients, but I feel like I don’t trust them to be significant results until they perform experiments trying to reduce these brain waves in these regions and there is some level of benefit to patients with chronic pain. Plus, I would love if they had some tech more advanced than scalp recordings. Just my thoughts, let’s move on.

Optogenetic and chemogenetic tools?

Feels like this is about to get interesting. To learn more, you have to read part 2.
