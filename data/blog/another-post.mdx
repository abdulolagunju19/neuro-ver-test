## Quote of the Post

> If Louis Pasteur were to come out of his grave because he heard that the cure for cancer still had not been found, NIH would tell him, “Of course we'll give you assistance. Now write up exactly what you will be doing during the three years of your grant.” Pasteur would say, “Thank you very much,” and would go back to his grave. Why? Because research means going into the unknown. If you know what you are going to do in science, then you are stupid! This is like telling Michelangelo or Renoir that he must tell you in advance how many reds and how many blues he will buy, and exactly how he will put those colors together. – Albert Szent-Gyorgi

“The Brain’s Glymphatic System: Current Controversies”
Article By Humberto Mestre, Yuki Mori, Maiken Nedergaard 

I’ll start this off with something of a preface. I am not a neuroscientist. I have never been in a lab, and I may never well work in a lab. Sometimes, some of the stuff I read feels like what you see in an instructional manual for a machine you will never use. Alas, someday I will have to make money off this shit, so I might as well understand how to read research articles. So we begin. In a lot of neuroscience work on the internet I read, you hear about synaptic connections, and neurotransmitters and their associated receptors, but it seems like I never see anything that tries to take on the complete architecture of the blood vessels and the fluids that move in these blood vessels and tries to elucidate their purpose. In my opinion, Glymphatics is the ugly girl at the dance that nobody wants to dance with. It’s the product that the MLM you read about tries to sell, and can only sell, by coercing people into a manipulative scheme. We know we need knives, but why your knives? Glymphatics feels like that. We care about glucose, and serotonin, but nobody cares about glymphatics. Its that green shit in your textbook you memorize so you can get an A and then forget about. Nobody gives a shit about what others have to say about the sewage system, we just want our shit to go away.
