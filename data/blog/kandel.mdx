You wake up. What do you have to get done today? Thoughts scramble in your mind, as you try to figure out what your mom told you about the dishes yesterday. Your mind sorts through your experiences from the past week, and you know you must brush your teeth, wash the dishes, and then rush to class before 8:15 am. 

How can you gather all of these events from the past? How can a collection of cells produce coherent thoughts in a human being? How can we remember events like the first time we rode a bicycle—so vividly? Memory is a powerful mechanism. Eric Kandel is the man who opened our eyes to how this mechanism works. Not completely, but enough that his research won him a Nobel Prize.

In this series of blog posts, I will talk about the book he wrote about his life, In Search of Memory, The Emergence of a New Science of Mind. I felt like the novel was well written and gave a lot of insight into how scientists came up with the foundations for neuroscience research.

The book begins with a discussion of Kandel’s life as a young boy, growing up in Austria, and escaping to the United States before World War II. One can only imagine how it would be like to grow up in a city that hates your very nature, with people who call the destruction of your race. 

Kandel escapes what surely would have been a brutal life in concentration camps, and he makes his way to America.  

Kandel becomes a star student and athlete, majoring in European history and literature in Harvard. He marries and begins a fascination the world of psychoanalysis. I feel like science is much more enjoyable when you are delving into a field in which the answers are not yet evident, in which you can hypothesize and question and really imagine lots of different truths. Psychoanalysis was a field like this. I mean, just take a look at the ideas Freud had. But Freud made the most with the empirical data he collected from his patients. He was a beacon for young scientists at this time, and his methods seemed futuristic and cutting edge. This draws in Kandel, and he decides to become a psychoanalyst. He enters medical school, learning about the mysteries of axons and the thalamus and the central nervous system. 

Kandel weaves the stories outlining the most important findings in neuroscience research in the past century. We learn about why Hodgkin and Huxley chose the axon of the squid, Freud’s model of psychoanalysis, Cajal’s explanation of neuroanatomy, and Sherrington’s classification of inhibitory cells. It is enlightening to say the least when you learn about why things are the way they are in neuroscience, why scientists performed the experiments they did and why they came to the conclusions they came to. The book is great, in part because Kandel is such an expert in the history of this field, and he is able to explain the developments in neuroscience so clearly and succinctly.

Kandel himself begins the practical application of his knowledge of biology, working in laboratories and learning from experiments involving placing electrodes on cat brains, the effects of LSD and serotonin (they work together in the visual cortex), and recording the crayfish axon. His stories about how he heard the banging of the action potentials on his due to connecting the electrical signal a loudspeaker give an insight into how experiments were performed back then. 

His research into Aplysia slugs reveal his research methodology, showing how you can gain new knowledge from the study of simple organisms. By reducing your problem by simulating it in a more simplistic environment, a lot can be revealed. 

> “To simulate habituation, I would apply repeated, weak electrical pulses to this neural pathway. To simulate sensitization, I would stimulate a second neural pathway very strongly, one or more times, and see how it affected the target cell’s response to weak stimulation of the first pathway. Finally, to simulate classical conditioning, I would pair the strong stimulus to the second pathway with the weak stimulus to the first pathway in such a way that the strong stimulus would always follow and be associated with the weak stimulus.”

Kandel learns that different forms of learning affect synaptic plasticity in different ways. The terms homosynaptic depression and heterosynaptic facilitation are coined by Kandel. He studies how neurons change how they communicate depending on the kind of electrical stimulation they receive.
