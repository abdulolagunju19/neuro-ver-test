These are some important cellular pathways I learned in my Cellular Biology class this past semester. In this blog you can look at some notes I made about these cellular pathways. If you want me to elaborate on any of the pathways in a separate article, feel free to contact me. I may choose to go into more detail in future blog posts.

1.	Firstly, it will be important to define GEF’s and GAP’s. Take a look at this diagram:
   *	  
   *	(https://www.promega.ca/fr-ca/products/cell-signaling/gpcr-signaling/gtpase-glo-assay/?catNum=V7681)
   *	There are small molecules called GTPases that are very important for regulating cellular pathways. 
   *	The GTPases can be turned on or off. They are off when they are bound to a GDP (guanine diphosphate) and they are on when they are bound to a GTP (guanine triphosphate). Take a look at the picture below and try to figure which molecule is the GTP or GDP (hint: search up what a phosphate is).
   *	 
   *	A GAP will remove a phosphate from GTP, resulting in the GDP being attached to the GTPase.
   *	A GEF will replace the GDP on the GTPase with a GTP, activating the GTPase.
   *	GPCR: G Protein Coupled Receptor
   *	cAMP: cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate)
2.	G Protein:
a.	G alpha bound to GTP, Ligand binds receptor, G alpha releases GDP and grabs GTP; GEF(Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor => this activates the GTPase, replace the GDP with a GTP) is GPCR, G protein activated, G alpha interacts with adenylyl cyclase, adenylyl cyclase makes cAMP, GAP (GTPase Activating Protein => this removes a phosphate from the GTP, resulting in GDP) turns GTP to GDP on G alpha
b.	 
c.	cAMP turns on Protein kinase A (usually floating in cytoplasm), Protein Kinase A changes shape after cAMP binds to regulatory subunit, kinase phosphorylates serine, threonine, or tyrosine
d.	G beta gamma can bind to K+ ion channel
e.	cAMP degraded by phosphodiesterase
f.	PKA can phosphorylate GPCR and deactivate it, deactivates GEF function of GPCR
3.	IP3
a.	Ligand binds to GPCR, G protein activated, Phospholipase C cuts PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, IP3 opens Ca2+ channel, DAG activates protein kinase C
b.	 
4.	Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK):
a.	Ligand binding module and tyrosine module on RTK, ligand binding activates tyrosine kinase, tyrosine kinase only phosphorylates tyrosine residues, autophosphorylation
b.	Proteins with src domain (kinase domain, sh2 and sh3 domain, sh2 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine), c terminus is phosphorylated or its not, when c terminus is not phosphorylated, src kinase domain can phosphorylate stuff
5.	JAK/STAT:
a.	RTK dimerization due to ligand, kinase is separate polypeptide clinging to cytoplasmic domain of receptor, kinase then activates STAT
6.	Ras Signaling (Important for Growth factors, cancer usually have activated Ras):

11.	Steroid binds to Hsp-Receptor complex, Hsp protein leaves, steroid complex enters nucleus
12.	Import Process:
a.	Protein made in cytoplasm with nuclear localization sequence, importin forms complex with protein, diffuses through nuclear pore (unstructured proteins in nuclear pore), Ran GDP hit by GEF (GEF for Ran in nucleus), RanGTP causes importin to release cargo, RanGTP importin complex diffuses out of nucleus, Ran GAP in cytoplasm causes RanGTP to turn to RanGDP and release importin
b.	Ran GDP shuttled back to nucleus
c.	  (https://www.mechanobio.info/what-is-mechanosignaling/what-are-small-gtpases/what-are-ran-gtpases/)
13.	Export process:
