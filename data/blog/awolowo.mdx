## Quote of the Post
> "I'm just happy that Jesus Christ, um, did not let me lose my teeth when I was 20 years old. 'Cause I was wondering, like, what if you kept your baby teeth until the age of 18 or 20, and then you lose 'em? That would look pretty bad." — Metta World Peace 

Today, we discuss one of the foremost figures in Nigerian history. The man called “The Greatest President Nigeria never Had,” a man who shaped the direction of a country that 200 million people now reside in. In history, some people have an outsized effect on the direction of millions, and I feel like a lot of African leaders who fit this criteria are not paid the respect they deserve. We don’t hear enough about their lives and how they shaped policies and governance. Let’s change that.

Nigeria is a mosaic of cultures, languages, and peoples, but usually they are classified into 3 major groups: the Yoruba, the Igbo, and the Hausa. To put it generally, the Hausa live in the North of the country, the Yoruba live in the Southwest, and the Igbo live in the Southeast. The divide geographically and culturally has led to a lot of civil strife and violence, but it has also generated some of the most fascinating individuals who I feel are not given the attention they deserve. 

It is difficult to find information about these leaders, but I used this book for information: Nigeria: A New History by Richard Bourne (fantastic read by the way).  Furthermore, I used this article: [Awolowo- The Lost President](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/442742-awolowo-the-lost-president-and-a-nation-in-grief-by-toyin-falola.html) to learn most of what I know about Awolowo. I also had discussions with other Nigerians who lived in the country at this time in order to learn about the way this man was perceived by his people during his own time.

Let’s take a critical look into his life, and the actions he took that helped shape a nation.

Obafemi Awolowo was born in Ogun state.  He lived a happy childhood. Unfortunately, pressure build diamonds. And Awolowo’s pressure was coming. His father died in 1920. His grandmother and mother moved away. Awolowo was alone. He had no money and no support system. He had to make his name. Awolowo got an education, developing ideas about how Africans should perceive themselves and act in a nation in which they had no control. A Nigerian nationalistic energy was developed in these years, a dream of a world in which Africans would rule themselves, in the best interest of the nation.

Awolowo failed at many businesses before becoming a lorry owner, fighting against monopolistic practices in order to give Nigerians a chance to succeed in business. Unfortunately, European firms continued to be successful due to their control of the law. All of these failures built up the man Awolowo was to become. It opened his eyes to what his country needed in order for him to build a prosperous government. 

We'll take a look at the rest of his story in another blog post.

Thanks for reading!
