Welcome to another blog post!
So, usually in these blog posts I talk about some scientific paper or famous individual, but let's try something different this time. Let's take a look at some web development.

So, this summer I started learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Next.js. In react, there are lots of cool libraries you can implement in your own projects. What does this mean? Well, other people write code to develop some fantastic applications, and it gets uploaded to something called the npm registry. You then use a package manager called npm to add all of these crazy cool pieces of code to your own projects. 

react-globe.gl is very cool. Take a look at this: [](). And take a look at this: [](). What about this: [](). People develop some fantastic stuff.

So, to add this to your project, you first have to create a react application. The Net Ninja has a great series on doing just that: [The Net Ninja- React](https://youtu.be/j942wKiXFu8).

Then, we have to add react-globe.gl to our project. Write npm i react-globe.gl or yarn add react-globe.gl to your command line (I write it to the command line of VSCode). Now you can use the library.

We'll go further in depth in the next blog post.

Thanks for reading!
