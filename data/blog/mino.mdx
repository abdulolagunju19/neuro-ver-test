Today, we go over an article named: “Minocycline reduces chronic microglial activation after brain trauma but increases neurodegeneration.” Why? I don’t know, I wanted to read a research article about microglia, so I searched up microglia on PubMed. I just clicked the first research article I could see. Alright, let’s begin!

Let’s see what we already know about this article by just reading the title. Yeah, I know it’s a mouthful. But from reading it I know that this article will probably be taking a bunch of patients who had brain trauma and giving them some chemical called minocycline (let’s get a picture of it while we’re at it):

We’ve got some aldehydes, alcohol groups, amine groups (from what my Org 2 prof said, anytime you see nitrogen in a chemical, expect it to fuck with your body), this chemical is big and bulky. From what I saw on google images, they use this for acne treatment, but I’m guessing the writers will tell me why they chose this chemical later on.
So, back to the title. This stuff stops microglia (think the army of the brain, they are a part of the brain’s immune response team), from getting activated like crazy, but it still leads to neurodegeneration. We will see what kind of neurodegeneration this is later on, hopefully.
So, let’s actually begin to read the article. In the introduction, the researchers talk about how bad brain trauma is, and how survivors tend to face many terrible diseases (like Alzheimer’s disease) after they get whacked really hard in the head. With people who get traumatic brain injuries, their white matter tracts (axons that are myelinated) fall apart due to microglia going crazy and some other stuff I do not know, but will look into later. 
Another important caveat they writers stated is: In rodent TBI models, microglia [are]…predominantly pro-inflammatory…However, studies in non-human primates in the
chronic phase suggest a reparative role. So, be careful about any conclusions you come up with about this study, because chronic microglia activation might actually be a good thing. Science can be so messy sometimes ☹. 
The researchers also tell us that they use PET ligand imaging (hopefully will write an article about this when I understand it) to measure whether the microglia are super activated, and that minocycline is an anti-inflammatory drug that can inhibit microglial activation in models of traumatic brain injury. Their hypotheses (kind of obvious from the title): lots of microglial activation leads to your brain turning to mush, and that people who suffer traumatic brain injury can be helped by minocycline because it will reduce microglial activations.
Let’s take a look at how the researchers designed this study. They used a randomized open-label trial? Let’s find out what that means. So…it’s a trial in which patients know which treatment they are given, but they are randomly separated into treatment groups. This study was performed in the UK, and it had a pretty small sample size. 10 patients who had suffered a traumatic brain injury received minocycline twice daily, whereas 5 patients received no minocycline. I feel like it would be difficult to find subjects for this study, I mean how many people would join this study? If I get a brain injury, I feel like I won’t take an experimental drug unless I’m in really bad shape. You have to weigh the risk vs. return. What if I get worse due to the minocycline? Thoughts like that probably limit the number of subjects you get for an experiment like this that will affect brain function.
It must be difficult for researchers to carry out these experiments, especially when they have exclusion criteria outlining patients can’t take drugs, have any problems prior to the traumatic brain injury, and they need to be healthy enough for PET scans, MRI scans, and insertions into their arteries. I feel like you should get paid as a patient for this stuff, otherwise why would you go through all the work of going to the clinic and following these guidelines? 
Another thing. Did these patients receive brain surgery after their traumatic brain injury? The researchers haven’t discussed this yet, but I feel when you open somebody’s head, introducing different things past the blood brain barrier, you may get atypical results from experiments you perform using them as test subjects.
Anyway, the researchers were thorough, even performing genetic tests so that the enzymes in their patients wouldn’t disturb the readings of the PET scan. Unfortunately, I feel like this study is hurt by the limited number of human subjects. Maybe trying to work with other hospitals globally would bring more insight, but I can see it would be very difficult to organize that.
The Logan graphical method was used to analyze the PET scan findings.
