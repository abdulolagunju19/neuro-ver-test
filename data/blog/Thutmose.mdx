## Quote of the Post

> "I set your glory and the fear of you in all lands, and the terror of you as far as the four supports of the sky...the rulers of all foreign countries are gathered together within thy grasp. I stretch out my hands to bind them for you." - Amon-Re to Thutmose III

You are what you do. And Thutmose III won 17 battles and lost none. Born to Thutmose II, he was named King after the short rule of his father. However, his stepmother, Hatshepsut, would seize the throne and rule Egypt. In the meantime, Thutmose III became well-versed in the art of war. This 5 foot 6 Egyptian was trained to be adept in military tactics and fighting as a soldier. He was a true polymath, devoted to learning about the military arts, biological phenomena, literary texts, and architectural designs. He was well read and well educated. His sharp mind allowed him to develop a vision for the future of Egypt.

Hatshepsut even gave him control of the armies before she died. You can imagine that as a ruler, it might be dangerous to hand over military control to your successor (and technically the person who should currently occupy the throne), but Hatshepsut still trusted him to do his duty. 

We will now delve into what made him one of the greatest Pharaohs ever. His military victories. Thutmose III would go on a military campaign approximately every year. This is remarkable. Can you imagine the amount of resources and planning that go into a military campaign? To organize one every year, for an army of the scale of Egypt's and win consistently, that is miraculous. 

Before Thutmose III had even attained the throne, Hatshepsut had given him control of the army in a military campaign to Nubia. He also fought to gain control of Palestine from rebels that had asserted their control. Hatshepsut died, and Egypt plunged into chaos. Their enemies were circling, testing the new young commander. Thutmose III had to prove he was up to the task.
