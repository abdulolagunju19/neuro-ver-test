Welcome to another awesome blog post! This is some interesting information about Thutmose III, a Pharaoh in the New Kingdom Egypt.

## Quote of the Post

> "I set your glory and the fear of you in all lands, and the terror of you as far as the four supports of the sky...the rulers of all foreign countries are gathered together within thy grasp. I stretch out my hands to bind them for you." - Amon-Re to Thutmose III

You are what you do. And Thutmose III won 17 battles and lost none. Born to Thutmose II, he was named King after the short rule of his father. However, his stepmother, Hatshepsut, would seize the throne and rule Egypt. In the meantime, Thutmose III became well-versed in the art of war. Hatshepsut even gave him control of the armies before she died. You can imagine that as a ruler, it might be dangerous to hand over military control to your successor (and technically the person who should currently occupy the throne), but Hatshepsut still trusted him to do his duty. 

We will now delve into what made him one of the greatest Pharaohs ever. His military victories.
